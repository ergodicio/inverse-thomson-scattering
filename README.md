# TSADAR
`TSADAR` performs Thomson Scattering analysis using Automatic Differentiation (AD) and GPUs (if available). At this time, it is heavily specialized towards analyzing data 
from OMEGA experiments at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics. However, there is no reason this cannot be extended to work with data
from other facilities

## Installation
This is multistep for now, at least on Mac, because `pyhdf` using `pip` has some problems. We can get around that by using conda

 - Install conda 
 - Make conda environment for `tsadar`
 - Install `tsadar` using `pip install https<>`
 - Install `pyhdf` using `conda`

## Automatic Differentiation
In Thomson Scattering, as in other parameter estimation inverse problems, there can be many parameters. In the case where the forward model is known, 
gradient-based methods can be applied to solve this many parameter optimization problem. Automatic Differentiation (AD) enables fast and efficient calculation of (relatively) arbitrary numerical programs. Here, we apply it to the form factor calculation.
