Dispersion Relation Integral
=============================

The dispersion relation integral is the most computationally expensive component. Because there is a pole in the
integral, we perform a rational integral that is described by the following routines


.. autofunction::   inverse_thomson_scattering.model.physics.ratintn.ratintn
.. autofunction::   inverse_thomson_scattering.model.physics.ratintn.ratcen
