def get_calibrations(shotNum, tstype, CCDsize):
    """
    Contains and loads the appropriate instrument calibrations based off the shot number and type of Thomson scattering
    performed. The calibrations loaded are the spectral dispersion, offset for the spectral axis, spectral instrument
    response functions (as the 1 standard deviation value), and a scale for the x-axis. In the case of temporal data
    this scale is the time per pixel. In the case of Imaging data the scale is a magnification and there is also an
    offset based off the TCC location. The calibrated axes are return as well as calibration values that will be needed
    later.

    For non-OMEGA data this function will have to be reworked.
